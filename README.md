# Introduction

[LuciusWeb](https://github.com/data-intuitive/LuciusWeb) is the web component of a data processing application where the data processing itself is done using Spark.

The app uses [cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) as a reactive Javascript framework. We used [cyclejs-started](https://github.com/andreloureiro/cyclejs-starter) to bootstrap the project.

This branch is a new vesion, with additional functionality and built from the ground up.
